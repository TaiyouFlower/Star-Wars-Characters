Website for the DevsData recruitment home assignment by Vito Gugushvili

!to run the application open the terminal and use
npm run dev

notes & etc
-I used Next.js because that's the the React framework I'm most comfortable with

-Since the SWAPI didn't provide characters' images(or at least I couldn't find them in documentation) 
I used "Star Wars Visual Guide" to implement media. That's the website I got the basic design idea from as well.

-Since some details were not mentioned in the assignment I took the judgment upon myself about some functionality based on whatever I would want in such website.

-Browse star wars characters - Enjoy & Have fun!
